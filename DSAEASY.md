# What is data structure? 👨‍💻

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a computer's memory or storage system. It provides a systematic approach to managing and manipulating data efficiently. Examples of data structures include arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.

## What is an array? 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️

An array is a data structure that stores a fixed-size sequence of elements of the same type. It provides random access to its elements using an index. Arrays are commonly used for storing and manipulating collections of data, such as a list of integers or characters.

In JavaScript, arrays are a bit more flexible than the definition above mentioned. In JavaScript, arrays can hold elements of different types, and their size is not fixed. They are implemented as objects with integer keys (indices) and have some array-specific methods and properties, but they can also have other properties and methods inherited from the Object prototype.

## What is a linked list? 🔗

A linked list is a data structure in which each element, called a node, contains a value and a reference to the next node in the sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations. However, accessing elements in a linked list requires traversing the list from the beginning.

## What is a stack? 📚

A stack is an abstract data type that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push (inserting an element onto the top of the stack) and pop (removing the topmost element from the stack). Stacks are often used for managing function calls, expression evaluation, and undo mechanisms

## What is a queue? 🚶🚶🚶🚶

A queue is an abstract data type that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two primary operations: enqueue (adding an element to the end of the queue) and dequeue (removing the element at the front of the queue). Queues are commonly used in scenarios where data needs to be processed in the order it arrives, such as scheduling tasks or handling requests.

## What is a tree? 👨‍👧‍👧

A tree data structure is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. It is used to represent a hierarchical structure with a single root node and a set of child nodes. Trees have various applications in computer science, including in data storage, searching, and organizing hierarchical data.

## What is a graph? 🗺️

A graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes (vertices) and edges that connect them. It is a powerful tool for representing relationships between objects. Graphs can be directed (edges have a specific direction) or undirected (edges have no
direction). They are widely used in network analysis, social networks, and pathfinding algorithms.

## What is the difference between an array and a linked list? 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️🚶‍♀️ 🆚 🔗

The main difference between an array and a linked list is their underlying structure and the operations they support. Arrays have contiguous memory allocation and provide direct access to elements using an index, allowing for fast random access. Linked lists, on the other hand, use nodes with references to the next element, providing efficient insertion and deletion at any position but slower access time.

## What is the difference between a stack and a queue? 📚 🆚 🚶🚶🚶🚶

The key difference between a stack and a queue lies in their order of operations. A stack follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, where the last element inserted is the first one to be removed. In contrast, a queue adheres to the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element inserted is the first one to be removed. Stacks are like a pile of plates, while queues resemble a line of people waiting.

## What is the difference between a tree and a graph? 👨‍👧‍👧 🆚 🗺️

While both trees and graphs are hierarchical structures, the main difference lies in their level of organization. A tree is a type of graph that does not contain cycles, meaning there are no loops or circular dependencies among the nodes. In contrast, a general graph can have cycles and arbitrary connections between nodes, allowing for more complex relationships.
